# get_next_line ðŸ”¨ Under construction!
A function that reads one line from a specified file descriptor every time it is called. 
In this project we learn about memory leaks, static variables, the read function and the -D preprocessor flag.

## What is a memory leak
A memory leak is basically losing the reference to dynamically allocated memory. Like let's say you malloc something and then you replace 
the address of what that pointer is pointing to: 
```c
int32_t main(void)
{
  char *ptr;
  
  
}
```
Usually memory allocation is done for you when you initialise variables on the stack.
